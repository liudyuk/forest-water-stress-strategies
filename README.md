# forest-water-stress-strategies for woody species across USA and Europe.
#1) data: there are two datasets in the folder. 
-US.EU.CWM_trait.txt, which indicates the eight functional traits for the forest communities.
-US.EU.species_level_trait.txt, which indicate the eight traits at species level.

#2) The R code for running the statistical analysis and making graphs is available.
#2.1. for the figures in the paper.
Fig. 2 R code for PCA at community level and their correlations and Fig.S2  PCA at species levels
Fig. 3 R code for main strategies distribution and fig S7 forest type distribution
Fig. 4 R code for testing the importance and correlations

#2.2 supporting files:
Fig.s2-s4 and s6 R code for testing the PC contribution, correlation and sensitivity test to exluding the communities less than 2 plots.
Fig. s5 Fig. s5 Sensitivity test for the grid cell sizes. The folder has six datasets with different community size (0.1 degree and 0.5 degree) and filling the missing trait gaps by applying (a) the median of genus and family and phylogenetic relationship, (b) median of genus and phylogenetic relationship and (c) only the phylogenetic relationship.
